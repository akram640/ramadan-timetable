# Icons Folder

Replace these placeholder icons with your own downloaded icons from the internet.

Keep the same file names so no code changes are required:

- `main-card-bg.png` (faded background art inside the main countdown card)
- `sehri-cup.svg` (Sehri row icon)
- `iftar-meal.svg` (Iftar row icon)

How to replace main card background:

1. Save your background image as `main-card-bg.png` in this folder.
2. Keep the other icon names unchanged, or update `index.html` if you rename them.

Note:

- If `main-card-bg.png` is missing, the card automatically falls back to a simple theme-based gradient.
